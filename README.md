This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase applications: attempting to access a database reference before the Firebase app has fully initialized. The `bug.js` file showcases the erroneous code that leads to this error.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that ensures the database operation is performed only after Firebase initialization is complete, avoiding potential crashes or unexpected behavior.  This is crucial for robust and reliable Firebase apps.
