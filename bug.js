The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a database reference before it's fully initialized. This can happen if you try to perform a database operation in the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method of a React component before the component has fully mounted and the Firebase app has been properly initialized.  For example:

```javascript
componentDidMount() {
  // Incorrect: Accessing database before initialization is complete
  const dbRef = firebase.database().ref('myData');
  dbRef.on('value', snapshot => {
    console.log(snapshot.val());
  });
}
```
